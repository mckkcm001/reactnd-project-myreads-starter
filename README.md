# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It was built from the starter code at
[reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). The ability to change
the shelf a book is on, including removing it from all shelves, was added. Also, the ability to search books not on a
shelf and add a particular book to a particular shelf was added.

## Instructions

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`
* On the book shelves page (the home page), the white cross in the green circle is the link to the search page
* On the search page, there is a back arrow to return to the book shelves page
